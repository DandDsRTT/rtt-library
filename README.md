# RTT Library in Wolfram Language

by Dave Keenan and Douglas Blumeyer.

The key file in this libary is `rtt-library.nb`; this is the file you'll want to upload to your free [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com) account online in order to use the library.

It also contains a few private files:
* `source.m`: the file that `rtt-library.m` is based upon.
* `tests.m`: contains tests that run against `source.m`.
* `api.nb`: used to deploy the functions used by the [RTT web app ]("https://danddsrtt.github.io") to API endpoints.

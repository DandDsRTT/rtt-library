# Tuning - all-interval tuning schemes - alternative complexities

This module contains functions supporting to all-interval tuning schemes with alternative (other than log-product
complexity) interval complexities, such as Benedetti, Weil, Kees, and their Euclideanized variants.

This module also requires `tuning/alternativeComplexities`.
